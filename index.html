      <h1>The Moon</h1>
      <p>The Moon is Earth’s oldest companion, hanging around for about 4.5 billion years and faithfully orbiting us at an average distance of roughly 238,855 miles, which NASA assures us is close enough to influence our tides but far enough to avoid awkward small talk. It’s tidally locked, meaning it always shows the same face to Earth—basically the cosmic equivalent of saying, “This is my good side, deal with it.” Despite looking bright and dramatic, the Moon doesn’t produce its own light; it just reflects sunlight, which feels very on-brand for something that gets credit for “moonlight” dinners. Its gravity is about one-sixth of Earth’s, which is why astronauts bounced around like kids on trampolines during the Apollo missions, probably thinking, “Why don’t my legs work like this at home?” The Moon also stabilizes Earth’s axial tilt, helping keep our climate relatively predictable—so while it may seem like a quiet background character, it’s actually doing serious behind-the-scenes work. If the Moon had a voice, it might say, “You’re welcome for the tides, the seasons, and the romantic night skies—no need to clap.”</p>
