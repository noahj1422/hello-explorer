      <h1>Earth</h1>
      <p>Earth is that one overachieving planet that spins at about 1,000 miles per hour, orbits the Sun at roughly 67,000 miles per hour, and still somehow gives us a consistent 24-hour day—according to NASA, multitasking is clearly its thing. About 71% of its surface is covered in water, which explains both why astronauts call it the “Blue Marble” and why humans keep insisting on building cities right next to oceans and then acting surprised when storms show up (looking at you, hurricanes). It’s the only planet we know of that supports life, thanks to a just-right atmosphere rich in nitrogen and oxygen, a protective magnetic field, and plate tectonics that recycle nutrients—basically, Earth is running an extremely complex life-support system and asking for nothing in return except maybe that we stop lighting it on fire. The planet is around 4.5 billion years old, which means it has survived asteroid impacts, ice ages, and mass extinctions, yet somehow plastic straws are what finally tested its patience. If Earth could talk, it might say, “I’ve handled lava oceans and global glaciation—could you at least recycle?” </p>
